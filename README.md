# 🛡️Managing a growing AWS infrastructure is exciting, but it comes with one major challenge—network complexity. As your architecture scales, you’ll likely find yourself managing multiple VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds) across various AWS accounts, regions, and even hybrid cloud environments

# 💡 The Challenge:
 Let’s say you’ve got multiple teams or departments, each with their own VPCs. As the organization grows, so do the VPCs. Soon, you’re tasked with connecting 10, 20, or even 100 VPCs while also linking to your on-premise data center. Sounds simple? Well, not when you’re dealing with complex routing rules, multiple peering connections, and isolated traffic paths.

# 🎯 The Solution: AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)
-- Enter AWS Transit Gateway—a centralized hub designed to manage and simplify complex multi-VPC and hybrid cloud architectures. With TGW, you can get your VPC peering chaos goodbye and move toward a clean, scalable, and efficient network solution.

# 🤔 How AWS Transit Gateway Solves the Problem:

• Centralized Routing: Transit Gateway acts as a single point of connectivity for all your VPCs, regions, and even on-prem resources. Instead of maintaining multiple peering connections, you attach your VPCs to the Transit Gateway, and it takes care of the rest. \

• Cross-Region Connectivity: No more worrying about connecting VPCs across regions. With inter-region peering, Transit Gateway ensures that your VPCs, even across the globe, can communicate with low latency. \

• Hybrid Cloud Integration: TGW integrates seamlessly with on-prem resources via AWS Direct Connect or Virtual Private Gateway, providing a unified, global network that’s secure and scalable.

# 🌎 Real-World Ex:
-- Imagine you’re part of a company with multiple departments—finance, HR, engineering—each running their own VPCs. Additionally, your company has data centers spread across different regions. Without Transit Gateway, you'd have to manually create peering connections between each VPC, set up VPNs for your on-prem data center, and configure routing tables for every connection.

-- With AWS Transit Gateway, you simply attach each VPC to a single, centralized hub. The Transit Gateway handles the routing for you, automatically managing traffic between VPCs and regions, and connecting to your on-prem network without complex VPN setups for every VPC. Plus, everything is controlled from one place!

# Steps to follow :

✅Setup VPC A,B,C \
✅Create Subnet in each VPC \
✅Create Route tables \
✅Edit Routes for all tables \
✅Create EC2 instances in each subnet \
✅Setup Transit Gateway \
✅Set Transit Gateway attachment to all VPCS A,B,C \
✅Create Transitive Peering Request and accept it from other region \
✅Edit Transitive Static Routes for each VPC's and Set the Target as Peering Request. \
